Fidelity Contract:  To be finalized once discussions with Fidelity have been finalized.  It is important to note the problems with the current contract which need to be addressed with Fidelity.  LH's notes from the previous Board Meeting have been added to the minute book.

Price Increase from Fidelity to the LRA:  Discussions started last week and have yielded positive results.  Fidelity presented a detailed breakdown to the LRA of costs that are covered by the Management Fee (""the pot"") and we now have a detailed cost per individual person and item to FSS.  It was requested by FSS and agreed by LRA that an exercise be done applying a margin to each line item so that if a line item be removed or added its margin would also be removed/added.  This has been done in order to maintain the same bottom line cost to LRA.  This would be the equivalent or approximately 10.9% margin per line item.

FSS, originally indicated a guideline increase of 8% and then, after discussions proposed a cost increase to the LRA of 7,5%; the LRA went back with a 6,82% offer. FSS's increase was based on applying CPI plus 2% (as per the gazette increase) to 80% of the costs (based on their rule of thumb approach of 80% wage to revenue ratio)  LRA's figure was based on a far more detailed analysis of applying a different increased index to each line item.   

A final negotiation settled on a cost increase of 7% to the LRA, effective 01 July 2014. Until the new proposal rolls out, the 7% will be applied to all line items on the current monthly remittance schedule

Fidelity Contract:  To be finalized once discussions with Fidelity have been finalized.  It is important to note the problems with the current contract which need to be addressed with Fidelity.  LH's notes from the previous Board Meeting have been added to the minute book.

Price Increase from Fidelity to the LRA:  Discussions started last week and have yielded positive results.  Fidelity presented a detailed breakdown to the LRA of costs that are covered by the Management Fee (""the pot"") and we now have a detailed cost per individual person and item to FSS.  It was requested by FSS and agreed by LRA that an exercise be done applying a margin to each line item so that if a line item be removed or added its margin would also be removed/added.  This has been done in order to maintain the same bottom line cost to LRA.  This would be the equivalent or approximately 10.9% margin per line item.

FSS, originally indicated a guideline increase of 8% and then, after discussions proposed a cost increase to the LRA of 7,5%; the LRA went back with a 6,82% offer. FSS's increase was based on applying CPI plus 2% (as per the gazette increase) to 80% of the costs (based on their rule of thumb approach of 80% wage to revenue ratio)  LRA's figure was based on a far more detailed analysis of applying a different increased index to each line item.   

A final negotiation settled on a cost increase of 7% to the LRA, effective 01 July 2014. Until the new proposal rolls out, the 7% will be applied to all line items on the current monthly remittance schedule

If SP was a director and she was not entitled to receive remuneration for March 2014, which she did.  LH commented that if this is the case, it is ""tantamount"" to fraud.  LH stated that SP appointed herself as a director fraudulently.
Resolution in this regard needs to be drawn up to safeguard the Board.

Our mandate is to protect the interests of Lonehill.
We are incorporated in terms of the Companies Act :-
-	The way the board are appointed
-	How we are regulated
-	How general and annual meeting are held and run
-	How we deal with money
All employees of an NPO are only allowed market related remuneration.
The board is appointed to ensure day to day running of association is attended to.
-	Need to account to our sponsors/contributors at end of year how we use the funds.
-	NF suggested the board decide what limits are set and delegations given
-	Employment always a board issue - any position created and salary discussion
-	Function of committees is to clear - lessen load of board.
-	Need to draft a resolution for each committee i.e security, marketing, remuneration and set clear parameters and let the committee's get on with it.
-	Reason for appointing committees is to make decisions and get things done.
-	Remuneration committee should be able to approve increases and bonuses for staff (excl. Manager) and brought to board for ratification - not authorization.
NF -      Not allowed to use NPO for own gains
             Have to be Transparent in all dealing
             Need to have a paper trail
             Need to deal with Minutes - not what we think is important- all needs to be minuted.
HMB requested NF to draft a resolution stating that the Chairman (JS) acted in good faith.  Note was taken of the contents and objections raised and note that in future all decisions relating to staff remuneration be brought to the board for ratification - not authorization.

HMB felt there were two issues, the first being that questionable/sloppy administration of the LRA Board and poor judgement of behalf of the Chairman and not corporate governance.  The matter is whether SP was a Director or not-   again slack administration in not ensuring the correct policies / procedures were followed after SP's appointment as a Director.  The delay in the appointment of a Manager resulted in a the necessity of a hand-over period, SP felt that during this time she needed to remunerated and indicated this in an email to the Chairman.  The Chairman agreed to SP being remunerated.  The second issue was what is underlying all of this and it is a question of leadership between the Chairman and the Manager and the Chairman and a Director. The Director had the grace to step down and remove herself from the situation. 
RS felt that SP's remuneration during her appointment as a Director while handing over to the Manager was an informal arrangement and it was accepted.  RS felt that the LRA cannot go back 6 months later and try and recover the money from SP. This would result in litigation and cost to the LRA of substantial legal fees and put the association in a poor light.
KB felt that a letter needs to be sent to SP addressing the issue at hand; he felt that SP needed to be made aware of the consequences.  
HMB advised KB that the LRA cannot accuse SP of wrongly earning a salary while being a Director of the LRA as she stated clearly that she will be billing for her time during the handover period.

At the previous Board Meeting AKE and KB were excused from the meeting and the voice recording device turned off.  Bonus payments for staff were discussed however various Board Members were in disagreement as to what exactly was agreed upon.
It was agreed at the meeting that 100% bonus payments would be given to administrative staff at the LRA.
It was also agreed that 100% bonus payments be given to all gardening staff.  DF objected to this as he felt that if a staff member was currently on a final written warning or currently under disciplinary review, how could the LRA justify a 100% bonus payout?  This issue was raised at the November meeting, discussed and moved on.
It has now been brought to the Boards attention that JL and Doug Black were of the understanding that between 40% and 50% bonus payments were authorized and done so accordingly.

Bonus payments to staff are not a right and are not stated as a given in Letters of Employment.  Staff need to be advised by letter from the Chairman and Manager that bonus payments going forward will be paid based on performance during the year.  

JS proposed that bonus payments to gardening staff be amended to 100% across the board to be in line with bonus payments made to the administrative staff.
