I must mention my concern that supervisors are not distributing radios timeously to our street guards.
 
Noticed this on Saturday morning after an incident in our bridle path +- 6/7 a.m. Street guard and park guard did not have radios.
 
Have just gone to check street guard opp. Highbrook at 8:30 a.m. this morning Tuesday… he is obviously a spare… but also does not have radio.
 
Is this now a common occurrence?
 
I am very concerned that Lonehill is about to be hit again.
 
Would also like to know where the drug bust in Lonehill took place… where were they staying?
 
Regards
Trevor Nel

Hi John,
I have once again requested your email details because the apparent thorn in some of the LRA's management -- has a complaint.
It is sad that the meeting which you and I held last year, proved to be no more than a sop to me or paying me lip service. I know Trevor Nel feels the same. 

I told you I had many ideas to improve Lonehill but was not prepared to be treated like a leper by some of the current LRA management.  

I have -- all my life -- held the saving and improvement of our planet's environment close to my heart. It is why I threw my heart and soul into Lonehill after Steve's shooting. 
However, the new Board of Trustees of Brookfield Close recently circulated the owners/residents with an email and a flyer to ""instruct"" the owners that our waste collection/management systems are","Please see attached email in documents","2014-01-22 16:31:00","","","6657","","6662","Waste and Enviro Complaint","5810","1","","","1","","","","","","",""
